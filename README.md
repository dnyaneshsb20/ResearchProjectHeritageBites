## About the Project

**Heritage Bites** is a **full-stack web application** built to preserve and promote traditional Indian recipes and support local farmers through an integrated **E-Market platform.**   

The platform allows users to explore regional recipes, view detailed cooking steps, share feedback, rate dishes, and learn the cultural significance behind traditional foods. Farmers can register, sell homemade or farm-grown products, manage their listings, and reach a wider audience.

Previously, such recipe collections and local market sales happened offline—through word of mouth, handwritten notes, and local booths. It was difficult to organize, update, and maintain.

With this software:
- Recipes are stored digitally
- Farmers can list products online
- Users can explore dishes with images, steps & ingredients
- Reviews and ratings help improve recipe discovery
- dmin can manage all data in a centralized dashboard
- Overall, it saves time, increases accessibility, and supports local communities
