    story: {
      content: `Dal Baati Churma is the crown jewel of Rajasthani cuisine, born from the harsh desert landscape where resourcefulness and nutrition were paramount. This iconic dish tells the story of Rajput warriors who needed portable, nutritious food during long battles and desert expeditions.\n\nThe baati, essentially a baked wheat ball, could be prepared in advance and stored for days without spoiling in the desert heat. Warriors would bury these in hot sand or cow dung to cook them slowly, creating a hard exterior that preserved the soft interior. The dal provided essential proteins, while churma offered quick energy from natural sugars.\n\nWhat makes this dish truly special is its representation of Rajasthani hospitality - the generous use of ghee symbolizes prosperity and the host's desire to nourish their guests completely. In traditional Rajasthani households, the amount of ghee poured over the baati is considered a measure of the host's affection for their guests.`,
      history: `Dating back to the 14th century, this dish was perfected during the reign of Maharana Pratap. The combination was designed to provide maximum nutrition with minimal water usage, crucial in the arid Thar Desert. Each component serves a purpose: baati for carbohydrates, dal for protein, and churma for immediate energy.`,
